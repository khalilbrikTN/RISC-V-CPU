11/3: 

Started Data Path

15/3:

Implemented the ADD instruction to perform arithmetic addition operations between two registers and store the result in a third register. 

Completed the SUB instruction, enabling the CPU to perform subtraction operations by subtracting one register from another and storing the result in a third register. 

Successfully integrated the AND instruction, allowing the CPU to perform bitwise AND operations between two registers and store the result in a third register. 

Finalized the OR instruction, enabling the CPU to perform bitwise OR operations between two registers and store the result in a third register. 

18/3: 

Collaborated on integrating the ALU module, responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations such as ADD, SUB, AND, and OR.
Ensured seamless communication between the ALU and other components within the CPU.

20/3: 

Collaborated on integrating the Control Unit module, responsible for generating control signals based on the fetched instructions.

Ensured accurate interpretation of instruction opcodes and generation of corresponding control signals.

Worked on supporting specialized instructions such as shifting and immediate generation.

Ensured proper execution of instructions requiring immediate values or shifts.

28/3:

Finished Data Path (added load control unit )
